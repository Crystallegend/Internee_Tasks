___________________STEPS TO IMPLEMENT CLOUD-BASED AWS STORAGE SYSTEM______________________

CONFIGURE EC2
--Launch a t2.micro(free tier eligible) or any other instance of your choice with a Linux AMI
--Add SSH, HTTP and custom TCP(port 5000) protocols in the security group
--Connect to the instance through SSH and run the following commands:
    sudo yum install python3 -y
    sudo yum install puthon3-pip -y
    pip install boto3, flask, flask-cors
    sudo yum install httpd

CONFIGURE S3
--Create a new general-purpose buckets with default settings

CONFIGURE IAM
--Create a new user without console access (give programmatic access)
--Attach to it a policy 'AmazonS3FullAccess'
--After creating it, generate an Access Key which will give you public and private key to connect your website with S3

CONFIGURE WEBSITE
--Download the web files on your local machine
--On your local machine, open powershell and run the following command to copy web file from your local machine to the aws instance
    scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i .\path_to_pem_key\key.pem '.\path to web files\*' ec2-user@{IPv4 address or DNS of instance}:
--This command will copy files to the home directory of your ec2-user on AWS instance
--On your AWS instance, Move script.js, styles.css and index.html to /var/www/html/
--Use following command to edit script.js file and add the IPv4 Public address of your AWS instance in the variable 'host_IP'
    sudo nano /var/www/html/script.js
--Now start the httpd service using following commands
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
--Now in your home folder, edit the app.py file with nano editor with the following command
    sudo nano app.py
--Set up S3_BUCKET, S3_KEY, S3_SECRET and S3_REGION with your data
--Now start the flask service with following command
    python3 app.py
--Now flask server should start and you are all setup

RUN WEBSITE
--Put IPv4 Public IP of your instance in the web browser to access the website
--Here you can upload, downlaod and delete files

NOTE
--This is a small project, giving its access to someone else can greatly harm your account as he can upload large files on your bucket
--Stopping and restarting the instance will change your IPv4 public IP and you will have to change IP in script.js file.
